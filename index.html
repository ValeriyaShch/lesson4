          In 1971, Carolyn and Roger Perron move their family into a dilapidated
          Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start happening around
          it with escalating nightmarish terror. In desperation, Carolyn
          contacts the noted paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren,
          to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area
          steeped in a satanic haunting that is now targeting the Perron family
          wherever they go. To stop this evil, the Warrens will have to call
          upon all their skills and spiritual strength to defeat this spectral
          menace at its source that threatens to destroy everyone involved.
